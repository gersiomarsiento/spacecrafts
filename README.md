# Spacecrafts!

## Welcome to this galactic project!

This web-app was designed using: 

**HTML**\
**CSS**\
**JavaScript**\
**Node.js**\
**Express.js**\
**MongoDB**\
**Mongoose**\
**jQuery**\
**EJS**

The app contains a 'seeds' folder that can be run with Node in order to delete all items from the DB and populate with 3 ships of each of the 3 ship types.

It is important to highlight the fact that I'm not very knowledged in OOP. Thus, I have tried to create an app using MongoDB and its Schemas, with which I'm much more familiar. As requested in the challenge, this app works as an inventory of spaceships, with the possibility of adding new spacecrafts and filter them. I have also added a method "reportSelf" that displays info for each of the different ship types accordingly.
